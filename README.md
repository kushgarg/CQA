# CQA
Community Question Answering (CQA) forums are gaining popularity online. They are seldom moderated, rather open, and thus they have few restrictions, if any, on who can post and who can answer a question. 
The challenge we propose may help automate the process of finding good answers to new questions in a community-created discussion forum (e.g., by retrieving similar questions in the forum and identifying the posts in the answer threads of those questions that answer the question well).

# Methodology
Implemented several string similarity and semantic algorithms to establish the relevance between two different text snippets.

## String-Matching Algo
1. Longest Common Sequence <br>
2. Cosine Similarity <br>
3. Jaro-Winkler Distance <br>
4. Damareu-Levenshtein Distance <br>
5. N-gram

## Semantic Algo

1. Named Entity Recognition <br>
2. Word Embedding Models - Word2Vec and GloVe
